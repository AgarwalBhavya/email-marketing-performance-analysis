# Email Campaign Analysis & Optimization - Quantacous Assignment

This repository contains my submission for the **Machine Learning Internship assignment** at [Quantacous.ai](https://quantacous.ai). The project analyzes the performance of an email marketing campaign and builds a predictive model to optimize click-through rates (CTR).

## 📁 Files Included
- `quantacus_ai assignment.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with full analysis, modeling, and insights
- `README.md` – Project overview and key results

---

## 📊 Objectives

1. **Calculate engagement metrics**: 
   - % of emails opened
   - % of emails clicked

2. **Build ML model to predict link clicks**:
   - Feature engineering
   - Model training and evaluation
   - Estimate CTR improvement using model-based targeting

3. **Explore user segment patterns**:
   - Performance by country, email version, length, and purchase history

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Personalized emails outperformed generic ones by a large margin.
- Users with more past purchases were significantly more likely to click.
- Short email versions led to higher CTR than long versions.
- CTR varied by country and send time, suggesting potential optimization in scheduling.

## 🧠 Model Performance

- **Model Used**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Metrics**:
  - Accuracy: ~97.45%
  - ROC-AUC: ~57.36%
  - Estimated improvement in CTR using targeting: ~8.82% increase
